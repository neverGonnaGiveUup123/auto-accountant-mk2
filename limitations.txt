Mistakes "bank overdraft" for "bank" account
Cannot do adjustments
Cannot handle multiple of the same account
New adjusted values must be written BEFORE the old values
Any dates must be written with "/" between the dates, not spaces (DD/MM/YY not DD MM YY)
Tends to mistake 1 for a 7. This is a common OCR mistake so not much I can do about it
Can't recognise accrued expense account
Can't have spaces in the money entries
